All the algorithms were written in python language. 


I used google colab to run the programs.

For the Fibonacci problem

- Run the file 'fibonacci.ipynb'
- The program will ask the user to enter the input string of numbers.
- Numbers can be typed with or without commas, or just a single integer value.
- The results are shown side by side containing nth input number/numbers, fibonacci result,
 recursive time, dynamic time and bottom-up time taken by the algorithms.


For the Matrix-chain-multiplication problem

- Run the file 'matrix_chain_multiplication.ipynb
- The program will ask the user to enter the number of matrices.
- Then it will ask the user to enter the p values.
- The results will show the optimal solution and the time taken for the recursive method,followed by
 optimal solution, optimal parenthesization and time taken by both memoized and bottom-up approach.

### Note: Input files named as 'Fibonacci_input' and 'matrix_chain_multiplication_input
 contains the input number for which the programs were tested.
